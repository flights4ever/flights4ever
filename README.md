- 👋 Hi, I’m Harry, a Computing and IT student from Belgium, entering my 2nd year at the Open University. I've chosen the Software Development specialty.

  -- Linux
  
  -- Python
  
  -- Gaming
  
  -- Building PC's
  
  -- Problem Solving
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Operating Systems, Python and German
